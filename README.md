# ECommerce_chrun_prediction
This project aims to analyze the customer base of an e-commerce site to identify factors contributing to customer churn. By understanding the characteristics of users who stop using the service, we can develop strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

Libraries Used: 
This project utilizes the following Python libraries:  
pandas - Data manipulation and analysis  
numpy - Numerical computing  
matplotlib & seaborn - Data visualization  
plotly - Interactive graphs  
sklearn - Machine learning models and evaluation  

Project Steps:  
Data Loading: Import dataset and explore basic statistics.  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and visualize patterns.  
Feature Engineering: Create new variables to improve predictions.  
Model Training: Apply machine learning models to predict churn.  
Evaluation & Insights: Assess model performance and extract key findings.
